# CS65 Final Project Proposal:

__Due__: Monday 11/21/22 by 11:59pm. 

The final project in CS65 provides an opportunity for you to develop a Python program of your choosing. 

The proposal requires a short (1/2-1 page) written description and a storybaord for your final project. 

To receive full credit on the final project you will need to use at least __15__ of the following __22__ elements:
- [ ] variables
- [ ] comments
- [ ] if statement
- [ ] complex bollean condition (`and`/`or`/`not`)
- [ ] Getting input from the user
- [ ] Printing output to the console
- [ ] Nested if-statement
- [ ] While loop
- [ ] For loop
- [ ] a graphics window
- [ ] a graphics animation
- [ ] uses a random number
- [ ] uses at least 1 user-defined function
- [ ] docstring for each function
- [ ] global variable
- [ ] local variables
- [ ] List
- [ ] Nested List (2D list)
- [ ] Reading from a file
- [ ] Dictionary
- [ ] Uses a custom class to create cutsom objects
- [ ] Changes an attribute of a custom object

## Part 1: Written Proposal

Your project propsal should be a word processing document (e.g. docx, pdf, Google Docs) and include the following informations:
1. Your name
2. The idea (the game, simulation, visualization, etc.) that you plan to implement for your final project.
3. Which of the above concepts you expect to include in your final projects (just an estimation, this can change by the time you submit your project). 
4. Any datasets you plan to use in your porject (if applicable)
5. A dvelopment plan:
    - start with a high level description and then make your way into pseudocode
    - what will you do first, second, third, etc.
    - what functions will you use or develop?

## Part 2: Storyboard
A storyboard should be a graphical description of the 'flow' of your project. 

The storyboard should consist of a few rough sketches of what your program will look like to help guide the development. If your project isn't very graphics heavy, that's okay, but still include the prompts/what the input/output of the program would look like.

## How to Submit:

Submit your pdf/docx/Google Doc link to Blackboard under Assignments--> Lab #14, Project Proposal, and upload your document before the deadline.
