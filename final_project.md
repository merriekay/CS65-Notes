# CS65 Final Project Proposal:

__Due__: Wednesday 12/7/2022 before 11:00am. 

## Updated December 6th!!
- ~~[ ] Accessibility feature~~ and ~~`dictionary`~~ were removed from the list, so you only need to include __14 of the 23 elements__ for full credit. 

The final project in CS65 provides an opportunity for you to develop a Python program of your choosing. 

The proposal requires a short (1/2-1 page) written description and a storybaord for your final project. 

To receive full credit on the final project you will need to use at least __14__ of the following __23__ elements:
- [ ] variables
- [ ] comments
- [ ] if statement
- [ ] complex bollean condition (`and`/`or`/`not`)
- [ ] Getting input from the user
- [ ] Printing output to the console
- [ ] One of the following operators `//`, `%`, `+=`, or `-=`
- [ ] Nested if-statement
- [ ] While loop
- [ ] For loop
- [ ] a graphics window
- [ ] a graphics animation
- [ ] uses a random number
- [ ] uses at least 1 user-defined function
- [ ] docstring for each function
- [ ] global variable
- [ ] local variables
- [ ] List
- [ ] Nested List (2D list)
- [ ] a List build using list comprehension format `[(x) for x in list]`
- [ ] Reading from a file
- ~~[ ] Dictionary~~
- ~~[ ] Accessibility feature~~
- [ ] Uses a custom class to create cutsom objects
- [ ] Changes an attribute of a custom object

You can work on the project in groups of up to 2 people. Even if you are working in a group, both partners will need to submit the proposal individually. 

## Individual Written Reflection
In addition to your code, the final project requires a short __individual reflection__-- a written component that answers the following questions:
1. Estimate how many hours you spend on the final project
2. Briefly (2-3 sentences) describe what you learned through completing your final project
3. Explain which of the core constructs (from the list above) you used in your project. Give an example of how/where you used it in your project. Line numbers and screenshots are great here.
4. Out of a scale from 0 - 100, give a proposed grade for your project. While I will be the final evaluator of your efforst, I would like you to self-assess your effort here. Add a few sentences that explains your score.

> This is not the time for modesty. 100 would indicate that you put in a significant effort, worthy of full credit for this project. 

## Project Presentation
Please come to class (CS301) on 12/7. You will be asked to join the Zoom session (even though you will be in class) so that you can easily share your screen and demonstrate your project to the class. 
There is no need to prepare slides or anything, a simple 2-3 minute presentation where you demonstrate your project and tell us something you learned will suffice. 

## Submit your Project via Blackboard.

Make sure you include the final code, as well as your individual reflection.
